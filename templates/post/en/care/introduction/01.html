These wolves, with more docile and less aggressive characteristics, were domesticated and became the first dogs.

            <p class="post-article-p">
                Over the centuries, the relationship between humans and dogs has developed significantly. With the advent of agriculture, dogs were trained to help humans with hunting and guarding livestock.

            </p>
            <p class="post-article-p">
                Today, the friendship between humans and dogs is stronger than ever. Dogs are considered members of the family in many cultures and many people are dedicated to caring for, training and playing with their dogs on a daily basis. The friendship between humans and dogs has become increasingly important for the mental and physical health of both.

            <p class="post-article-p">
                The friendship between humans and dogs has many benefits for both sides. Dogs provide companionship, love and loyalty to their owners, while humans provide their dogs with food, shelter and care. In addition, the friendship between humans and dogs has been scientifically proven to be beneficial to the physical and mental health of both.
            </p>
            <p class="post-article-p">
                For humans, owning a dog can lower stress, blood pressure, and the likelihood of developing heart disease. Dogs can also help reduce loneliness and improve self-esteem. In addition, dogs are excellent motivators for physical activity, which can help prevent sedentary-related diseases such as diabetes and obesity.
            </p>
            <p class="post-article-p">
                For dogs, having a human owner is essential for their health and well-being. Dogs need social contact and affection, and many dogs without human owners can develop behavioral and health problems due to lack of social interaction. Also, dogs with human owners tend to live longer and have fewer health problems.
            </p>
            <p class="post-article-p">
                In summary, the friendship between humans and dogs is an ancient and important relationship that has many benefits for both sides. Accompanying, caring for, and playing with a dog can be extremely beneficial for humans' physical and mental health, while dogs need a human owner for their own well-being.
